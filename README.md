PROJECT DESCRIPTION:FemMe Power,Empowering Women in Rural Areas with Personalized Job Matching, Easy Applications, Chatbot Assistance, Safety Measures, Employer Partnerships, Training & Development, and Community Support for Access to Diverse Career Paths and Professional Growth Opportunities, to Create a More Equitable and Inclusive Workforce for Women in India.



PROBLEM STATEMENT: Despite having the skills and potential to excel in various fields, women in inner villages often face limited job opportunities and lack the resources and support needed to pursue their career goals. Additionally, the job application process can be daunting and confusing for many women, and safety concerns further hinder their ability to seek employment in cities. As a result, there is a significant gap between the potential of women in rural areas and their ability to access fulfilling and secure jobs.

The FemMe Power aims to address this problem by developing a platform that utilizes advanced algorithms to match women in inner villages with job opportunities in cities that align with their skills and preferences. The platform will provide a simplified and user-friendly application process, chatbot assistance, real-time safety and security measures, and partnerships with a range of employers to offer diverse job opportunities. Additionally, the platform will provide training and development opportunities and a supportive community where women can connect with each other, share advice and resources, and build networks that can help them succeed in their careers. By developing this platform, we aim to empower women in inner villages to pursue their career goals and bridge the gap between their potential and access to job opportunities.
